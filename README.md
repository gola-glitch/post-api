## Scripts
### Prerequisites
* You need docker and docker-compose installed.

### Format source code
    make format

### Install dependencies
    make install_deps
    
### Build go binaries
    make build
    
### Go vet linter

### Getting started as a service
###Steps to run post-api in local environment using docker compose
    make start

### Stop the app and db
    make stop
    
### Lint new docker files
    make hadolint

### healthcheckz
    make healthcheck
    
### DEV guidelines
### Install pre commit and pre push hooks for code quality
    make install_hooks
    
### To uninstall hooks
    make uninstall_hooks
    
### Update swagger documentation
### Setup swaggo
    go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag

### Update
    swag init
    
### Dev practices
    * Always use git add -p for additing changes to staging
    * Use exact type for casting data from database (example: if it is a autogenerated id always use int64 which is equalt to autoincrement range)
    * Check if migration workind properly by running make targets and check the logs or db if changes reflected*
    * Follow the commit message standard "[Dev-Name] : What feature does it contain and if refactor or modification specify the intent"
    * Use same name for all receivers for example (func(controller SomeController) A(){} func() B(controller SomeController){}). in this both are assinged to someController but the reciever names are same. try to use generic names like controller for controller, service for service and repository for repository
    * If conflicts arises try to resolve it and continue rebase in command line itself (Always try to use command line for git usages)
    * place corresponding models to corresponding packages i.e (if a model used to return as a response then it should be under models/response folder).
    * Run all the test for each and every commit (objective of making a commit is when we are having a commit it should not have any errors, even though the commit related files are passing it is always better to run all tests).
    * Don't push the code if tests are failing and functionality doesn't have a test (test is mandatory, without test a feature shouldn't exist).
    * before pushing do a make format to make sure all the code are formatted properly
    
**Please strictly follow the above dev practices which eventually helps to evolve as a good programmer** PS.(any fool can write code that a computer can understand but a good programmer write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler)
